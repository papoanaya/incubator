;;; Commentary:

;; Org-Babel support for evaluating ditaa source code as eps/pdf.
;;
;; Almost verbatim copy from ob-ditaa, but with ditaa-eps and epstopdf
;; as intermediate step.
;;
;; Ditaa differs from most standard languages in that
;;
;; 1) there is no such thing as a "session" in ditaa
;;
;; 2) we are generally only going to return results of type "file"
;;
;; 3) we are adding the "file" and "cmdline" header arguments
;;
;; 4) there are no variables (at least for now)

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)

(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:ditaa-eps
  '((:results . "file") (:exports . "results") (:java .
"-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8"))
  "Default arguments for evaluating a ditaa source block.")
