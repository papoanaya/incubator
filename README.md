incubator
===========

Incubator contains code that is midway in development or design.

- regina.el : REXX mode, which is a mash up of netrexx.el and
  rexx.el. In this way I have an electric mode with syntax highlight for
  developing REXX scripts. LOOP is not working, use DO. 
- mantislib.el : Copy of jira2.el library for the Mantis bug tracking
  system.  It is still in development, but getting there. These can be 
  used in combination of other tools for access data from Mantis tickets. 
  It is still a work in progress, a lot of functions are not
  done. 
- dorglendar.nlsp : orglendar clone for dzen2 using newlisp
- plantuml_helpers.el : This is a Gits I found in github for plantuml in
  which simplifies compiling plantuml files. It would be nice to have a
  plantuml mode in Emacs. I'm dropping this gist here as a basis for
  such mode.
